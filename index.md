## Election Coverage in Augmented Reality

**XR Elections** is an augmented reality experience that brings political debates to your dining table at home. It invites viewers to ask questions such as: How does the speech of one candidate compare to another? Are candidates saying something substantial? And how do my opinions compare to others? 

Using XR Elections, viewers can capture the moments they find most interesting, characterize what they hear, and compare to what others, physically and virtually present, think.
