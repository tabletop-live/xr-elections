## Election Coverage in Augmented Reality

**XR Elections** is an augmented reality application that enhances how viewers watch political debates at home. It invites viewers to consider questions such as: How does the speech of one candidate compare to another? Are candidates saying something substantial? And how do my opinions compare to others? 

Using XR Elections, viewers can capture the moments they find most interesting, characterize what they hear along dimensions of value, and compare to what others, both physically and virtually present, think. 

XR Elections was developed for the **NYC Media Lab's 2020 Spatial News Challenge**, in partnership with the **New York Times R&D Lab**. It was built using Unity, AR Foundation and Google Firebase.
